<h1>What is CSS?</h1>

<p>CSS is Cascading Style Sheets. Cascading Style Sheets is a language that is used to apply formatting and visuals to web pages. It does so by changing the way a browser visualizes HTML.</p>

<p>Example: The following code makes the text in all paragraphs in an HTML page 12pt in size, using the Verdana font, in italics with half inch margins:</p>

<pre>
p { 
  font: italic 12px Verdana;
  margin: .5in;
}
</pre>

<p>If you have a web site that contains hundreds of HTML pages that all link to the same stylesheet, adding the code above in that stylesheet will change every paragraph in that web site.</p>

<a href="page3.html">Let's see a page written in HTML without CSS, then the same page with CSS</a>
