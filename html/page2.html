<h1>What is CSS?</h1>

<p>CSS is Cascading Style Sheets. Cascading Style Sheets is a language that is used to very powerfully apply formatting and visuals to web pages. It is used to change the look and behavior of existing HTML tags using visual attributes and units of measurement unsupported by HTML.</p>

<p>If you have a web site that contains hundreds of HTML pages that all link to the same stylesheet, you can change one line of code in that stylesheet and fundamentally change the aesthetics of the entire web site.</p>

<p>Example: The following code in a stylesheet makes all paragraphs in a site 12pixels in size, using the Verdana font in italics with half inch margins:</p>

<pre>
p { 
  font: italic 12px Verdana;
  margin: .5in;
}
</pre>
