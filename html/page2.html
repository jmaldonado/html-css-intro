<body bgcolor="#c1c1c1">
<h1>Let's explore more HTML tags</h1>

<p>We have added an attribute to the body tag to make the background color of the page a bit more interesting.</p>

<i>This text is in italics</i>. This text here is not.<br />
<u>This text is underlined</u>.<br />
<b>Here is some bold text</b>.<br />
<br />
<br />
See the text in italics above? It was done by using the &lt;i&gt; tag, like so:
<pre>
&lt;i&gt;This text is in italics&lt;/i&gt;. This text here is not.
</pre>

<p>Now let's guess what the tags are for the underlined text and the bold text. View the source code and see!</p>

<h2>Ordered and unordered lists</h2>

<ul>
  <li>This is a list item in an unordered list.</li>
  <li>The &lt;li&gt; tag denotes all the different list items.</li>
  <li>Your browser interprets these list items and automatically adds line breaks between each one, and creates the bullets and adds indents.</li> 
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>This is an ordered list.</li>
  <li>The browser interprets list items in much the same way as list items in an unordered list but with a very important difference.</li>
  <li>Have you spotted the difference yet?</li>
</ol>
