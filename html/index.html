  <h1>This is (a very, very basic) page written with HTML</h1>

  <p>Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is simply text which has been marked up so that a web browser can render web pages on the World Wide Web with different colors, graphics and hyperlinks. HTML should always use a minimal amount of code to get the job done.</p>

  <h2>Here is a smaller header than the one you see above.</h2>

  <p>Headers range in size from h1 (which is the largest) to h6 which is the smallest.</p>

  <p>This is a paragraph. It has a opening tag and an ending tag that denote when this paragraph starts and ends. The web browser then adds a line break before and after this paragraph.

The browser

ignores

line breaks in code, however. It just considers them extra space. Speaking      of         space, it     ignores those too, after the     first one. 
</p>

<p>This is a link to <a href="http://google.com" target="_new">Google</a>, the best search engine around. I have added an attribute to the hyperlink called <font color="red">target</font> which will tell your browser to load in a different tab, rather than in this tab.</p>


<p>Forget what Juan is telling you about why Sir Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web. The real reason is to post animated GIFs of cats like this one:</p>
